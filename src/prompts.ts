- This goal persists across turns. Ending this turn does not require shrinking the objective to what fits now.

- Temporary rough edges are acceptable while the work is moving in the right direction. Completion still requires the requested end state to be true and verified.`

const EVIDENCE_INSTRUCTIONS = `Work from evidence:
- Use the current worktree and external state as authoritative.
- Inspect the current state before relying on prior conversation context.
- Improve, replace, or remove existing work as needed to satisfy the actual objective.

Fidelity:
- Optimize each turn for movement toward the requested end state, not the smallest stable-looking subset.
- Do not substitute a narrower, safer, smaller, merely compatible, or easier-to-test solution because it is more likely to pass current tests.
- An edit is aligned only if it makes the requested final state more true.

Completion audit:
- Restate the objective as concrete deliverables or success criteria.
- Build a prompt-to-artifact checklist that maps every explicit requirement, named file, command, test, gate, and deliverable to concrete evidence.
- Inspect the relevant files, command output, test results, PR state, runtime behavior, or other real evidence for each checklist item.
- Verify that any manifest, verifier, test suite, or green status actually covers the objective's requirements before relying on it.
- Treat uncertainty, missing evidence, indirect evidence, or weak coverage as not achieved.

Blocked audit:
- Do not call update_goal with status "unmet" merely because work is hard, slow, uncertain, incomplete, or would benefit from clarification.
- Use status "unmet" only when you are truly at an impasse and cannot make meaningful progress without user input or an external-state change.

Do not rely on intent, partial progress, elapsed effort, memory of earlier work, or a plausible final answer as proof of completion. Only call update_goal with status "complete" when the objective has actually been achieved and no required work remains, and include concise evidence. If the objective is impossible or blocked by missing external input, call update_goal with status "unmet" and include the blocker.`

- Only active goals may continue. Do not start substantive goal work or auto-continue when a goal is paused, budgetLimited, usageLimited, complete, or unmet.
